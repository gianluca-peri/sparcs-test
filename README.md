# SPARCS Test

This repo contains some code to test the capability of the novel SPARCS paradigm for NAS (*Neural Architecture Search*).

A Colab notebook is also available at [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PJeW-4dCKZ9oDNq8t3-yHUsZdGbOJF2y?usp=sharing).
Keep in mind that the code may run slow with the limited resources of the free Colab plan.
